### 8. Performance Optimization
- **Task:** Optimize backend queries and database operations to improve application performance.
- **Task:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce server load and enhance response times.
- **Task:** Minimize resource usage and optimize codebase for faster loading times.

### 9. Documentation and Testing
- **Task:** Create comprehensive documentation covering project setup, features, and usage instructions.
- **Task:** Write unit tests for critical application components to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.
- **Task:** Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback and address any usability issues.

### 10. Deployment and Maintenance
- **Task:** Prepare the application for deployment to a production environment.
- **Task:** Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Task:** Establish monitoring and logging systems to track application performance and detect potential issues.
- **Task:** Develop a maintenance plan for regular updates, security patches, and feature enhancements.
